# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project-for-Micro-It
A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides a fun and visually clean 3x3 grid-based game interface where two players alternate turns to place their marks (X and O). The game tracks wins, handles draws, and offers game reset and restart functionalities.
